# JoditHtmx

A learning, side project. This is one repository and one small application in a single repository. With these two parts:

 - A server folder with a .NET Core server side MVC web application with two pages
 - A client folder with a Typescript, Vite, Node-based application which holds an instance of the [Jodit WYSIWYG editor](https://xdsoft.net/jodit/)

In the .NET Core application I have integrated client/server communication by using [htmx](htmx).

Htmx is a technology that enables you to create dynamic web applications without the need for creating a huge single page application solution.

Also, I have proved that you can easily combine a custom Typescript module, with a .NET Core application and make things dynamic with htmx.
